> Well, lots of people have asked, so here it is. We are done with UTComp development, so we figured we might as well release the source code to our work so that people, if interested, can build and improve on it. A few notes about the release:
> 
> - We've decided to release this under the GPL. For those living under a rock for the past 15 years, this means that anything you create using the UTComp source has to also be released with its source under the GPL. This also means we still retain ownership over the code, and therefore could decide to let people use it in closed-source programs (via a separate private license) if deemed necessary. Read the included gpl.html file for more info.  
>
> - This is actually from v1.6, and not 1.6a. The source to 1.6a was lost due to a mishap in backup procedures. This means that any fixes done to 1.6a (as seen in the changelog in the readme for the released version) won't be in this version. Sorry.  
>
> - The source does not come with any documentation whatsoever, and the code has very few comments. Therefore, it might not be the best code to read if you are trying to learn unrealscript. Basically, 99% of it was done by one guy, without expecting it to ever go public, so making it human-readable has always been at a lower priority. For the most part, it works, and that's what has mattered to us   
> 
> Thanks for all the great feedback you've all given us during these fifteen months of development.
